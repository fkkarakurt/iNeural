## How to contribute to iNeural

- Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/fkkarakurt/iNeural/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature or issue. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

- Before sending a pull request for a feature, be sure to have [tests](https://github.com/fkkarakurt/iNeural/tree/master/test).

- Use the same coding style as the rest of the [codebase](https://github.com/fkkarakurt/iNeural/tree/master/src). If you are using Visual Studio Code, I request you to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [C/C++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) plugins.
